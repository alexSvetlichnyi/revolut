Revolut 
Android Test Application

You should implement one screen with a list of currencies


The app must download and update rates every 1 second using API
https://revolut.duckdns.org/latest?base=EUR

List all currencies you get from the endpoint (one per row). Each row has an input where you
can enter any amount of money. When you tap on currency row it should slide to top and its
input becomes first responder. When you’re changing the amount the app must simultaneously
update the corresponding value for other currencies.

Use any libraries and languages(java/kotlin) you want. UI does not have to be exactly the same, it’s up to you.
